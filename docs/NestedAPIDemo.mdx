# Nested Methods

Rimless supports nested method schemas. Remote APIs can expose deeply nested
functions and you can access them using dot notation on the `remote` object.

For example, a worker may expose:

```ts
{
  user: {
    profile: {
      get: () => ({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })
    }
  }
}
```

You can call this from the host with `remote.user.profile.get()`.
